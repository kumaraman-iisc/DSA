Description:
You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the i-th digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading zeroes.

Write a function to increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.



Input Parameters:

digits (List[int]): A list of integers where each integer represents a digit of a large number.

Output:

List[int]: The list representing the number after incrementing it by one.



Example:

Input: digits = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 4]
 
Input: digits = [4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [4, 3, 2, 2]
 
Input: digits = [9, 9, 9]
Output: [1, 0, 0, 0
