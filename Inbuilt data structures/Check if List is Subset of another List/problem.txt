Check if a List is a Subset of Another List (Brute Force Approach)

You are given two lists of integers. Write a Python program that checks whether the first list is a subset of the second list using a brute-force approach, without using the in keyword. A list is considered a subset if all elements of the first list are present in the second list.

Parameters:

lst1 (List of integers): The first list, which is being checked as a subset.

lst2 (List of integers): The second list, which is the list to compare against.

Returns:

A boolean value True if lst1 is a subset of lst2, otherwise False.

Example:

Input: lst1 = [1, 2, 3], lst2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: True

All elements in lst1 are present in lst2.

Input: lst1 = [1, 6], lst2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: False

The element 6 is not present in lst2.
