Problem Description:

You are given two strings s and t. Your task is to determine if string t is a subsequence of string s. A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (or no) characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.



Input:

Two strings s and t where the length of s is between 1 and 1000, and the length of t is between 1 and 1000.



Output:

Return True if t is a subsequence of s, and False otherwise.



Example:

Input: s = "abcde", t = "ace"
Output: True
 
Input: s = "abcde", t = "aec"
Output: False
