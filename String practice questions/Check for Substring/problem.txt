Problem Description:

You are given two strings, s and t. Your task is to determine if the string t is a substring of the string s. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. Do not use any built-in functions for string operations and do not use recursion.



Input:

Two strings s and t, where 1 <= len(s), len(t) <= 1000.



Output:

A boolean value (True or False) indicating whether t is a substring of s.



Example:

Input: s = "hello world", t = "world"
Output: True
 
Input: s = "hello world", t = "worlds"
Output: False
