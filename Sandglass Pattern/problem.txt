Problem Description:

You are given an integer n. Your task is to return a sandglass pattern of '*', where the first row contains 2n - 1 stars and each subsequent row decreases the number of stars by 2, until the last row contains a single star. After reaching the smallest width, the pattern then continues with the same number of stars increasing back to 2n - 1. The stars in each row should be centered.



Input:

A single integer n, where 1 <= n <= 100.



Output:

A list of strings where each string represents a row in the sandglass pattern.



Example:

Input: 3
Output: ['*****', ' *** ', '  *  ', ' *** ', '*****']
 
Input: 4
Output: ['*******', ' ***** ', '  ***  ', '   *   ', '  ***  ', ' ***** ', '*******']
