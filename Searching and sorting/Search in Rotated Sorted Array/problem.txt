Description:
Given a sorted array that has been rotated, find the index of a given target value. The array was originally sorted in ascending order and then rotated at some pivot.



Parameters:

nums (List[int]): A list of integers sorted in ascending order but rotated at an unknown pivot.

target (int): The integer value to search for in the array.

Return Values:

int: The index of the target value in the array, or -1 if the target is not in the array.



Example:

Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], target = 0 
Output: 4 
Explanation: The target value 0 is at index 4 in the rotated array.
 
 
Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], target = 3 
Output: -1 
Explanation: The target value 3 is not present in the array.
