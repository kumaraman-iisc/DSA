Description:
Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer target, find the starting and ending position of the given target value. If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].



Parameters:

nums (List[int]): A list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.

target (int): The target value to search for.

Return Values:

List[int]: The starting and ending positions of the target value in the array. If the target is not found, return [-1, -1].



Example:

Input: nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], target = 8 
Output: [3, 4] 
Explanation: The target 8 appears from index 3 to index 4.
 
 
Input: nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], target = 6 
Output: [-1, -1] 
Explanation: The target 6 is not found in the array.
